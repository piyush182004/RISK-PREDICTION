    Based on the following financial data extracted from a PDF, predict how much loan the person can take and the repayment period. Consider their income, expenses, and any other relevant financial data from the text:

    {pdf_text}

    {user_text}

    Consider the person's available monthly income after expenses, and calculate:
    1. The loan amount they can afford, assuming they can repay 30% of their available income monthly.
    2. The repayment period in years, based on typical interest rates (5-8%) for personal loans.

    Output the result as:
    "The amount this person can take loan in INR is X and repay it in Y years,this person can have to pay Z amount per month for Y years/months along with interest."
